François Jouen is director of CHArt (Human and Artificial Cognition Lab) in Paris and Director of Studies at EPHE (Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Université Paris Sciences et Lettres). For more than 20 years, he worked at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and studied the epigenetic approaches of the human development. Recent topics of research concern the development of motor imagery and brain computing in human children and the development of infrared technology for measuring pain in preterm infants and neonates. François began to program at University, and at MIT, in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics for the implementation of space-orbit biological experiments. He is now mainly involved in image processing and in the development of low-cost eye-tracking system and contactless monitoring systems for biological signals.
